# Github Bud
A project that uses Github's API and OAuth to show statistics and graphs about github users and their repositories. This was for a Module 3 project at [Turing School of Software and Design](http://turing.io) named [API Curious](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown).
